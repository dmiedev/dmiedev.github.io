Tired of manually checking status of application for temporary or permanent residence
permit on the website of the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic?
[Povoleni.com](https://www.povoleni.ru/) will check everything for you!

The robot checks the list of applications on the official website several times
a day and notifies you immediately if your number appears: it is as simple as that.

Made in collaboration with [Ilya Rudomilov](https://www.rudomilov.ru/),
creator of [Podebrady.ru](https://www.podebrady.ru/), the biggest
Russian-language site about education in Czech Republic.
