The life goal that I chose consciously is to improve the world. Even if I cannot do something at first, my real curiosity, hard work, and creativity make it more than possible. 

I believe the most valuable trait that belongs to humans is the ability to learn, and thus I am committed to constant learning and open-minded for new things. I always build my knowledge by deeply immersing in what I study and paying attention to details. I think this is what can make me a professional in any field I choose to study. I do not try to overcome myself, though. To successfully learn, it's crucial to take small bites of information regularly. Apart from this, I know many other learning concepts, one of them being the most essential: practice. That is why I am used to learning new things by solving real-life problems.

However difficult it is or what skills it requires, I always strive to the goal and try to do my best. The genuine passion for work, stubbornness, and pursuit of the ideal: this is what makes me move forward and not give up halfway.

For me, there are no "right" paths that other people usually are constrained. The only right path is thinking outside the box. It is the only way for creativity and novelty as there cannot be anything new if the same approach is taken time after time. Of course, this alternative method can cause more mistakes, but I do not fear them because they are hints to next moves and are signs of the development. This mindset is what makes me creative. Discovery and breaking unspoken norms allow finding new ways that may become the next norm. Consequently, creativity is fundamental for development.

My most distinguishing feature is the ability to reflect, deeply analyze, and try to get to the truth by all means. One example of this is introspection which has allowed me to understand my strengths and weaknesses. The text you are reading is also a consequence of it.
